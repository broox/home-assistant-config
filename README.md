# Home Assistant Config

These are the config files for my personal [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/), home automation setup.

My goals:

1. Ditch SmartThings due to instability, confusing UIs/setup procedures, not a lot of local network processing, and their lack of official support for all of my devices.
2. Make all of my various hardware and services able to interact with each other.
3. Require no (or extremely minimal) use of a software based user interface.

# Hardware I'm using

* Aeotec Minimote, Multisensor, and Z-Stick Gen 5
* Amazon Echo Dots
